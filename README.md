# Reservo

The Reservo app simplifies the process of making a reservation at your restaurant. The app is built purely in Kotlin which allows some of the most up to date functions available while remaining available to most devices by supporting a minimum of Android 5.1 Lollipop.

Currently only available for Android.

# _Features_
- Reservo makes it easy for your customers! This app allows them to:
- Choose a specific date and time to reserve
- Specify the number of guests attending
- See the dining room layout and choose a table
- Review their confirmed reservations
- Cancel their reservations up to a day before



# _Feedback_
Feedback is always welcome, whether errors are encountered or if you have an idea to improve the app, it can be sent to me via email -here-!
